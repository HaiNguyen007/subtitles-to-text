# SRT to TXT

Bulk converts a folder containing .srt files to a single .txt file. 

I use it to convert the subtitles from Udacity in a single readable text file.

## Usage

```
npm start <folder containing .srt files>
```

This will take all the .srt files from the given folder, combine them in a .txt file, and output the result
in the parent of the given folder.

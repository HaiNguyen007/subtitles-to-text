# Subtitles to text

A convertor of subtitle files (SRT) into plain text or HTML. 

It supports converting a single file, multiple files, or one (or more) multiple ZIP archives containing subtitles. If multiple files are given,
they are sorted alphabetically, and their contents will be grouped into chapters.
